## Weekend 1: Image to HTML/CSS

This repo contains HTML and CSS created to match an existing website called skinnyties.com, without many of the bells and whistles of the actual site.


Through this assignment, we were able to utilize more of what we learned about creating layouts with css-- floating and positioning, adjusting display settings, creating (or using pre-existing ones more likely) forms, using sprites, adjusting my code too meticulously for the good of my eyes and general well-being.
