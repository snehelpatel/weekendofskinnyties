## Weekend 1: Image to HTML/CSS

This repo contains HTML and CSS created to match an existing website called skinnyties.com, without most of the bells and whistles of the actual site.


Through this assignment, we were able to utilize more of what we learned about creating layouts with css.

**Including**
* floats
* positions
* display setting
* forms
* sprites
